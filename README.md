This unit introduces students to the concepts, methods and tools used to produce Web sites that are technically sound, aesthetically cohesive and appropriately structured.

This includes:

* technical overview of the **WWW**
* structuring content with **MarkDown** and **HTML**
* organising projects with **Git**
* styling pages with **CSS**
* making pages dynamic with **PHP**
* using **WordPress** to manage online content  
* developing **WordPress templates and themes**
* buying a **domain** 
* **hosting** a website
* transferring files with **FTP**
* **project management** basics: listing and prioritising tasks, tracking and evaluating progress, getting things done

Using individual practical projects, students will research, conceptualise and prototype a Web site that they chose to re-design. 


## Brief

Pick one *bad* website and re-design it.

Your re-designed version must 

* be **online** (not just on your computer)
* be **dynamic** (update-able via a CMS) 
* be **responsive** (adapting to different screen sizes)
* be **accessible** (for people with disabilities and limited devices)
* be visually **cohesive** and coherent
* have **appropriately structured** information
* have a style informed by (but not necessarily following) contemporary trends
