# Draw *the Web*!	

But what do you mean by *the Web*? 

Imagine you have to explain what the Web is to an alien, or to your grandma. You can also draw what the Web means to you, personally.. no need to make a technical drawing.

	
# How does the WWW work?

Research one key Web concept and then explain it to your classmates

[Use this collaborative Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NrRUySCy8CUf7Wrc4cbjwxsWh_fk6jXs47oMCnEljLk/edit?usp=sharing	) to collect links and jot down your notes

1. Each student picks one concept
2. You'll have about 1 hour to research and take notes
3. Then 5 minutes to explain (~1 hour in total)
